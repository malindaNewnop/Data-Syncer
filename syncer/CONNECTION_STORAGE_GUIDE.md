# Connection Settings Storage System

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a connection settings storage system for the Data Syncer application. This allows users to save their connection data so they don't have to re-enter it every time they restart the application.

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Storage Location
- Connection data is stored in the Windows Registry under: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DataSyncer\Connections`
- Each saved connection is stored as a separate registry key with the connection name
- The system also attempts to auto-load saved connections on application startup

### 2. Storage Method
When users click "Save Connection" in the connection dialog, the following data is stored:
- **Protocol**: The connection type (LOCAL, FTP, SFTP)
- **ProtocolType**: Numeric protocol identifier (0=Local, 1=FTP, 2=SFTP)  
- **Host**: Server hostname or IP address
- **Port**: Connection port number
- **Username**: Login username
- **SshKeyPath**: Path to SSH key file (for SFTP connections)
- **Timeout**: Connection timeout value

### 3. Auto-Loading on Startup
- When the application starts, it automatically checks for saved connections
- If the current connection settings are empty (default local connection), it attempts to load a previously saved connection
- The most recently saved connection is loaded automatically
- Success/failure of auto-loading is logged to the application log

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### In FormConnection.cs:
- **SaveConnectionToStorage()**: Saves connection data to both registry and service
- **SaveToConnectionsRegistry()**: Stores connection data in Windows Registry
- **LoadConnectionFromRegistry()**: Static method to load a specific connection by name
- **LoadDefaultConnectionFromRegistry()**: Static method to auto-load the first available connection
- **Auto-load in InitializeServices()**: Automatically loads saved connection when opening connection dialog

#### In FormMain.cs:
- **AutoLoadDefaultConnection()**: Automatically loads saved connection on application startup
- **UpdateConnectionStatus()**: Updates the status bar to show current connection info

### 5. User Experience
1. **Saving Connections**: 
   - User enters connection details in the Connection Settings dialog
   - Clicks "Test Connection" to verify settings work
   - Clicks "Save Connection" to store the settings persistently
   - Connection is saved with a generated name (e.g., "FTP - user@server.com:21")

2. **Auto-Loading**:
   - When user restarts the application, saved connection is automatically loaded
   - User sees connection status in the status bar
   - No need to re-enter connection details

3. **Status Display**:
   - Main form status bar shows current connection (e.g., "Connection: FTP://user@server.com:21")
   - Green text indicates connection is loaded, red indicates not configured

### 6. Technical Implementation Details

#### Registry Structure:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DataSyncer\Connections\
├── "FTP - user@server.com_21"
│   ├── Protocol: "FTP"
│   ├── ProtocolType: 1
│   ├── Host: "server.com"
│   ├── Port: 21
│   ├── Username: "user"
│   └── SshKeyPath: ""
└── "SFTP - admin@myserver.com_22"
    ├── Protocol: "SFTP"
    ├── ProtocolType: 2
    ├── Host: "myserver.com"
    ├── Port: 22
    ├── Username: "admin"
    └── SshKeyPath: "C:\keys\mykey.ppk"
```

#### Error Handling:
- All registry operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failures are logged but don't crash the application
- If loading fails, the application continues with default settings

#### Security Considerations:
- Passwords are NOT stored for security reasons
- SSH key paths are stored, but not the actual key content
- Users need to re-enter passwords, but all other settings are remembered

### 7. Future Enhancements
The current implementation provides the foundation for more advanced features:
- Multiple named connections with a connection manager dialog
- JSON-based storage for better portability
- Encrypted password storage
- Default connection selection
- Import/export of connection settings

### 8. Testing the Feature

To test that connection storage works:

1. **Save a Connection**:
   - Open Connection Settings from the menu
   - Configure FTP or SFTP settings
   - Test the connection to ensure it works
   - Click "Save Connection"
   - You should see a success message

2. **Verify Storage**:
   - Close the application completely
   - Restart the application
   - The saved connection should be automatically loaded
   - Check the status bar - it should show the connection details
   - Open Connection Settings - fields should be pre-populated

3. **Check Registry** (Optional):
   - Open Windows Registry Editor (regedit)
   - Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\DataSyncer\Connections`
   - You should see your saved connections as registry keys

### 9. Logging
The system logs important events:
- "Connection '[name]' saved successfully" - when a connection is saved
- "Default connection auto-loaded on application startup" - when auto-load succeeds
- Warning messages if loading fails
- All logging goes through the standard ServiceLocator.LogService

This implementation provides a reliable, user-friendly way to persist connection settings across application restarts, significantly improving the user experience by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter connection details.
