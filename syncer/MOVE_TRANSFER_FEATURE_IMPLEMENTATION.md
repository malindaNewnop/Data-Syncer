# Move/Cut Transfer Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a "Delete source after transfer" feature that provides move/cut functionality for file transfers between local and remote locations. This feature allows users to transfer files and automatically delete the source files after successful transfer, effectively implementing a move operation.

## Feature Description
- **Checkbox Control**: Added "Delete source after transfer" checkbox next to the existing "Include Subfolders" checkbox in the Timer Settings group
- **Move Functionality**: When checked, source files are deleted after successful transfer verification
- **Safety First**: Source deletion only occurs after successful transfer verification
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged with detailed information
- **Error Handling**: Failed deletions are logged as warnings but don't fail the transfer operation

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Changes (FormSchedule.Designer.cs)
- Added `chkDeleteSourceAfterTransfer` checkbox control
- Positioned at coordinates (200, 115) next to the "Include Subfolders" checkbox
- Text: "Delete source after transfer"
- Default state: Unchecked (false)
- Tab index: 9

### 2. Data Model Updates (Models.cs)
- Added `DeleteSourceAfterTransfer` boolean property to `SyncJob` class
- Default value: false (for safety)
- Properly initialized in constructor

### 3. Upload Functionality (FormSchedule.cs)

#### PerformUpload Method
- Enhanced to delete local source files after successful upload verification
- Verification includes checking if remote file exists
- Delete operation wrapped in try-catch to prevent transfer failure
- Detailed logging for both successful deletions and failures

#### PerformFolderUpload Method
- Similar implementation for folder uploads
- Deletes individual files after each successful upload
- Maintains folder structure during deletion process

### 4. Download Functionality (FormSchedule.cs)

#### DownloadFile Method
- Enhanced to delete remote source files after successful download
- Uses `_currentTransferClient.DeleteFile()` method
- Proper error handling and logging

#### PerformFolderDownload Method
- Deletes remote files after successful download
- Processes each file individually
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

#### PerformSpecificFileDownload Method
- For timer-based specific file downloads
- Deletes remote source after successful download
- Enhanced logging and error handling

### 5. Job Management
- **SaveJob**: Persists the `DeleteSourceAfterTransfer` setting to job configuration
- **LoadJobSettings**: Restores checkbox state when loading saved jobs
- **Configuration Management**: Setting is included in saved/loaded configurations

## Safety Features

### 1. Transfer Verification
- For uploads: Verifies file exists on remote server before deleting local source
- For downloads: Confirms successful download before deleting remote source
- If verification fails, source files are preserved

### 2. Error Handling
- Delete operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failed deletions are logged as warnings, not errors
- Transfer success is not affected by deletion failures
- Detailed error messages in logs

### 3. Logging
- All delete operations are logged with file names and results
- Success: "Source file deleted after successful transfer: filename"
- Failure: "Failed to delete source file filename: error message"
- Warnings don't affect overall transfer status

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Local to Remote (Upload & Move)
1. User selects local files/folders for upload
2. Checks "Delete source after transfer" checkbox
3. Files are uploaded to remote server
4. After successful upload verification, local files are deleted
5. Result: Files moved from local to remote

### 2. Remote to Local (Download & Move)
1. User browses and selects remote files/folders
2. Checks "Delete source after transfer" checkbox
3. Files are downloaded to local destination
4. After successful download, remote files are deleted
5. Result: Files moved from remote to local

### 3. Timer-Based Operations
- Works with both upload and download timer jobs
- Setting is saved in job configuration
- Automatic move operations during scheduled transfers

## Technical Implementation Notes

### .NET 3.5 Compatibility
- All code written for .NET Framework 3.5 compatibility
- Uses compatible file operations and error handling
- No newer framework features used

### Transfer Client Integration
- Uses existing `ITransferClient.DeleteFile()` method
- Works with all transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP, Local)
- Maintains consistency across different connection types

### UI Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing UI
- Consistent with application design patterns
- Proper control positioning and sizing

## Files Modified

1. **syncer.ui\FormSchedule.Designer.cs**
   - Added checkbox control and properties
   - Added to control initialization and layout

2. **syncer.ui\FormSchedule.cs**
   - Enhanced PerformUpload method
   - Enhanced PerformFolderUpload method
   - Enhanced DownloadFile method
   - Enhanced PerformFolderDownload method
   - Enhanced PerformSpecificFileDownload method
   - Updated SaveJob and LoadJobSettings methods

3. **syncer.ui\Models.cs**
   - Added DeleteSourceAfterTransfer property to SyncJob class
   - Updated constructor for proper initialization

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Upload Test**: Select local files, enable delete source, upload and verify local files are deleted
2. **Download Test**: Select remote files, enable delete source, download and verify remote files are deleted
3. **Folder Test**: Test with folders containing multiple files
4. **Timer Test**: Create timer jobs with delete source enabled
5. **Error Test**: Test with file permission issues to verify error handling

### Edge Cases
1. **Permission Issues**: Test with read-only files
2. **Network Issues**: Test with connection problems during transfer
3. **Large Files**: Test with large files to verify behavior
4. **Concurrent Access**: Test with files being used by other processes

## Benefits

1. **User Efficiency**: One-click move operation instead of separate copy and delete
2. **Storage Management**: Automatic cleanup of source files
3. **Consistency**: Works across all transfer modes and protocols
4. **Safety**: Verification-based deletion prevents data loss
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing features

## Conclusion

The move/cut transfer feature has been successfully implemented with comprehensive safety measures, detailed logging, and full integration with the existing Data Syncer application. The feature provides users with efficient file movement capabilities while maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback on all operations.
