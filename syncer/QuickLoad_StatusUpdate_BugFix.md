# Quick Load Status Update Bug Fix

## Issue Description
When using the Quick Load function to load saved configurations, the status section at the bottom of the main form (showing "Service: Stopped, Connection: Connected (Local File System)") was not updating to reflect the new connection settings that were loaded from the saved configuration.

## Root Cause
The `ApplyLoadedConfiguration` method was missing calls to update the UI status displays after applying the new connection settings. The connection settings were being saved correctly, but the UI wasn't being refreshed to show the new status.

## Bug Fix Implementation

### Changes Made to `FormMain.cs`:

#### 1. Added Status Updates to ApplyLoadedConfiguration Method
```csharp
// Refresh the UI and update status displays
RefreshTimerJobsGrid();
UpdateConnectionStatus(); // Update connection status display
UpdateServiceStatus(); // Update service status display

// Force UI refresh for .NET 3.5 compatibility
Application.DoEvents();
```

#### 2. Added Small Delay for .NET 3.5 Compatibility
```csharp
// Apply connection settings
if (config.SourceConnection?.Settings != null)
{
    connectionService.SaveConnectionSettings(config.SourceConnection.Settings);
    
    // Small delay to ensure connection is properly applied (.NET 3.5 compatibility)
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100);
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced User Feedback
- Added success messages for Quick Load operations
- Added confirmation when configuration is loaded
- Added confirmation when configuration is loaded and job started

### Technical Details

#### Methods Updated:
- `ApplyLoadedConfiguration()` - Core method that applies saved configurations
- `btnQuickLoad_Click()` - Quick Load button handler
- `btnQuickLoadAndStart_Click()` - Quick Load & Start button handler

#### .NET 3.5 Specific Considerations:
- Used `System.Threading.Thread.Sleep()` instead of async/await (not available in .NET 3.5)
- Used `Application.DoEvents()` to force immediate UI refresh
- Used string.Format() instead of string interpolation for compatibility

## How the Fix Works

### Before (Bug):
1. User clicks Quick Load
2. Configuration settings are applied internally
3. ❌ Status bar still shows old connection info
4. ❌ User doesn't know if the load was successful

### After (Fixed):
1. User clicks Quick Load
2. Configuration settings are applied
3. ✅ Connection settings are saved with small delay
4. ✅ `UpdateConnectionStatus()` refreshes connection display
5. ✅ `UpdateServiceStatus()` refreshes service display
6. ✅ `Application.DoEvents()` forces immediate UI update
7. ✅ Success message confirms the operation

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Loading FTP Configuration:
- Status should update to: "Connection: Connected (FTP - ftp.example.com)"
- Service status should reflect current state
- User gets confirmation message

### When Loading SFTP Configuration:
- Status should update to: "Connection: Connected (SFTP - sftp.example.com)"
- Service status should reflect current state
- User gets confirmation message

### When Loading Local Configuration:
- Status should update to: "Connection: Connected (Local File System)"
- Service status should reflect current state
- User gets confirmation message

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Save an FTP configuration
- [ ] Use Quick Load to load the FTP configuration
- [ ] Verify status bar shows "Connected (FTP - servername)"
- [ ] Save an SFTP configuration  
- [ ] Use Quick Load to load the SFTP configuration
- [ ] Verify status bar shows "Connected (SFTP - servername)"
- [ ] Save a Local configuration
- [ ] Use Quick Load to load the Local configuration
- [ ] Verify status bar shows "Connected (Local File System)"
- [ ] Test "Load & Start Job" button
- [ ] Verify status updates immediately when configuration is loaded
- [ ] Verify success messages appear

## Files Modified
- `syncer.ui/FormMain.cs` - Added status update calls and user feedback

## Compatibility
- ✅ .NET Framework 3.5 compatible
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Backwards compatible with existing saved configurations
