## FAQ

Frequently asked questions and answers.

### General Questions

**Q: What is DataSyncer and what does it do?**
A: DataSyncer is a file synchronization application that automatically transfers files between local directories and remote servers using FTP, SFTP, or local copying. It supports scheduled transfers, file filtering, and monitoring.

**Q: Do I need special permissions to install DataSyncer?**
A: Yes, you need Administrator privileges for the initial installation to set up the Windows service. After installation, it can run with normal user privileges.

**Q: Can DataSyncer run without an internet connection?**
A: Yes, for local file copying between folders on the same computer or network. Internet connection is only required for FTP/SFTP transfers to remote servers.

**Q: How much disk space does DataSyncer require?**
A: The application itself requires about 50MB. Additional space is needed for temporary files during transfers and log files (typically under 100MB total).

### Installation and Setup

**Q: I get an error about .NET Framework when starting DataSyncer. What should I do?**
A: You must install .NET Framework 3.5 before running DataSyncer. Follow the detailed installation instructions in the ".NET Framework 3.5 Installation" section of this manual.

**Q: Windows SmartScreen is blocking DataSyncer. Is it safe to run?**
A: Yes, DataSyncer is safe to run. SmartScreen warnings appear for new or unsigned applications. Click "More info" then "Run anyway" to proceed with installation.

**Q: Can I install DataSyncer on multiple computers?**
A: Yes, you can install DataSyncer on multiple computers. Each installation is independent and can have its own configuration and sync jobs.

**Q: Where are DataSyncer settings stored?**
A: Settings are stored in the Windows Registry and configuration files in the application directory. User-specific settings are stored in the user's profile.

### Configuration and Usage

**Q: What's the difference between FTP and SFTP?**
A: FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the standard but transmits data unencrypted. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is secure and encrypts all data transmission. Always use SFTP when security is important.

**Q: Can I sync in both directions (bidirectional sync)?**
A: Basic bidirectional sync is supported but requires careful configuration to avoid conflicts. For complex bidirectional needs, consider running separate upload and download jobs.

**Q: How often can I schedule sync jobs?**
A: Jobs can run as frequently as every minute, but consider server performance and network impact. Most users schedule jobs every 15 minutes to several hours depending on their needs.

**Q: Can I exclude certain file types from synchronization?**
A: Yes, DataSyncer provides comprehensive filtering options including file types, sizes, patterns, and file attributes. Configure filters when creating each sync job.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My connection test passes but file transfers fail. Why?**
A: Connection tests only verify basic connectivity. Transfer failures can be due to permission issues, file locks, insufficient disk space, or specific directory access restrictions.

**Q: Files are not transferring even though the job shows as running. What's wrong?**
A: Check your file filters - they may be excluding all files. Also verify the source directory contains files and the destination is writable.

**Q: DataSyncer service keeps stopping. How do I fix this?**
A: Common causes include insufficient permissions, system resource limitations, or configuration errors. Try running as Administrator and check Windows Event Log for detailed error messages.

**Q: Transfer speeds are very slow. How can I improve performance?**
A: Try adjusting buffer sizes in SFTP settings, enabling compression for text files, scheduling transfers during off-peak hours, and checking your network bandwidth.

### Security and SSH Keys

**Q: Is it safe to store passwords in DataSyncer?**
A: DataSyncer stores passwords encrypted, but SSH key authentication is more secure. Consider using SSH keys for SFTP connections instead of passwords.

**Q: How do I create SSH keys for SFTP?**
A: Use DataSyncer's built-in SSH key generation tool (Settings → SSH Key Generation) or external tools like PuTTYgen. The manual includes detailed steps for key creation and installation.

**Q: Can I use existing SSH keys with DataSyncer?**
A: Yes, DataSyncer can use existing OpenSSH format keys. Browse to your existing private key file in the connection settings.

**Q: What should I do if my SSH key is compromised?**
A: Immediately generate new keys, update server configurations with the new public key, and remove the old public key from all servers.

### Advanced Features

**Q: Can DataSyncer resume interrupted transfers?**
A: Yes, SFTP transfers support resumption for large files. This feature can be enabled in Advanced SFTP Settings.

**Q: Does DataSyncer verify file integrity after transfer?**
A: Yes, integrity verification can be enabled in Advanced SFTP Settings. It uses checksums to verify files transferred correctly.

**Q: Can I get email notifications when jobs complete or fail?**
A: Email notifications are not built-in, but you can monitor logs and use Windows Task Scheduler to send emails based on log events.

**Q: Is it possible to run DataSyncer from command line?**
A: Yes, DataSyncer includes a console version (syncer.console.exe) for command-line operation and automation scripts.
